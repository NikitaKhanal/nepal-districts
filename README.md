### Inspiration:

Inspired from the states game in friends (season 7, episode 8) and <https://iafisher.com/projects/cities/usa>, this is the version where you are challenged to name all the districts in Nepal.

### Technologies Used:

I decided to start with an MVP of a simple static website made with **[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org)** Nextjs provided me with the flexibility to shift to a dynamic website if needed later on. I used **[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)** for styling.

### Roadmap:

These are features I want to implement if this project gets some stars/tractions. I am also open to contributions.

- [x] Animations
- [ ] Show some interesting fact about the district when user types in a correct district.
- [ ] Casual and Hardcore mode (timed)
- [ ] Leaderboard for hardcore mode
- [ ] ~~List districts by different factors like population, area. (Super hardcore)~~
- [ ] Separate mode where user can guess the district by shape, location and maybe some facts
- [ ] Better Error Handling
- [ ] Multiple spelling support
